# OG Image Generator for My Projects


Welcome to my OG Image Generator for my projects! This tool helps me generate Open Graph (OG) images for my various projects. OG images are great for creating eye-catching previews when sharing links on social media platforms.

### Features

- **URL Parameters**: This OG image generator allows me to customize the image content dynamically using URL parameters. I can specify the `title` and `type` parameters in the URL to generate unique OG images for my projects. For example:
  ```
  https://og.anit.dev/og-image/?title=YourTitle&type=YourType
  ```

- **Base URL**: I've hosted this OG image generator on [anit.dev](https://og.anit.dev) to seamlessly integrate it into my project's infrastructure.

- **Upcoming Features**: I'm continuously improving the OG image generator! Some exciting upcoming features include different background options to make my OG images even more appealing.

## Getting Started

To start using the OG Image Generator for my projects, follow these steps:

1. **Customize the URL**: Customize the URL with the `title` and `type` parameters to generate unique OG images.

2. **Include in My Project**: I can use the generated OG image URLs in my project by including them in the appropriate `meta` tags or wherever I need them.

## Usage

Here's an example of how I can use the OG Image Generator in my project:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
